ðŸš€ Freelancer Earnings Dashboard â€“ Key Insights! ðŸ’¼ðŸ’°

Recently, I did an analysis of freelancers' earnings by their experience levels, payment methods, types of projects, etc, and these are some of the most interesting results from the dashboard I created using Power BI. 

Approximate Freelancer Earnings are above $226.2K. 

The average balance for other freelancers rests at $5.03k.

ðŸ”¥ Experience Matters? Not Always!

Middle level freelancers trump the rest at $109.16k. Surprisingly, out of all categories, experts earn the least ($36.09k) â€“ could this mean experience isnâ€™t always the key to higher income? 

How Do Freelancers Get Paid? 

The clear winner is undoubtedly bank transfer leading this category with undertaking $86.84k worth of transactions followed by crypto and PayPal. Mobile payments however, tend to be the black sheep in this, being the least preferred. 

ðŸ›  Hourly vs. Fixed Price Projects? 

Hourly projects clearly take the trophy at $0.17 million being earned. Contrary to this, fixed price projects remain stagnate at $0.05 million, proving that freelancers prefer hourly payment. 

As rate of job success (close to 100%) increases, so does the earning of freelancers, adding validity to the correlating relationship. From the details provided, Asia remains a firm hotspot dominating in earnings.

ðŸ’¡ Businesses and professionals alike can benefit from these strategies. Have you come across any patterns in freelancing? Let's chat below! ðŸ‘‡
